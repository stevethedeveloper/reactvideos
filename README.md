ReactJS YouTube Search
==================

This is a demo single page application in ReactJS that searches YouTube using their API, displays results and plays the videos.

The structure and functionality is relatively straightforward.  The app utilizes the usual React packages, as well as youtube-api-search and lodash.

You can view the app at http://www.stevethedeveloper.com/videos, or you can clone it and run it locally.
